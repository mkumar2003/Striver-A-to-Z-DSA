## C++ STL

Q) WHAT IS STL? 
---
The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is a collection of algorithms, data structures, and other components that can be used to simplify the development of C++ programs. The STL provides a range of containers, such as vectors, lists, and maps, as well as algorithms for searching, sorting and manipulating data.
- One of the key benefits of the STL is that it provides a way to write generic, reusable code that can be applied to different data types.
- The STL also provides a way to write efficient code. Many of the algorithms and data structures in the STL are implemented
- Some of the key components of the STL include:
1. Containers: The STL provides a range of containers, such as vector, list, map, set, and stack, which can be used to store and manipulate data.
2. Algorithms: The STL provides a range of algorithms, such as sort, find, and binary_search, which can be used to manipulate data stored in containers.
3. Iterators: Iterators are objects that provide a way to traverse the elements of a container. The STL provides a range of iterators, such as forward_iterator, 
   bidirectional_iterator, and random_access_iterator, that can be used with different types of containers.
4. Function Objects: Function objects, also known as functors, are objects that can be used as function arguments to algorithms. They provide a way to pass a 
   function to an algorithm, allowing you to customize its behavior.
5. Adapters: Adapters are components that modify the behavior of other components in the STL. For example, the reverse_iterator adapter can be used to reverse the 
   order of elements in a container.
