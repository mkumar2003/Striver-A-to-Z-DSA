// Stacks are a type of container adaptors with LIFO(Last In First Out) type of working, where a new element is added at one end (top) and an element is removed from that end only

// The functions associated with stack are: 
// empty() – Returns whether the stack is empty – Time Complexity : O(1) 
// size() – Returns the size of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1) 
// top() – Returns a reference to the top most element of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1) 
// push(g) – Adds the element ‘g’ at the top of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1) 
// pop() – Deletes the most recent entered element of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1)
